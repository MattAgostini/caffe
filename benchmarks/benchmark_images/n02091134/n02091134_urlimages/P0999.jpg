<p>Planning a wedding can be a pretty intense and stressful experience. There are a million details to work out and a ticking clock that gets louder and louder with each passing day. In order plan a wedding successfully, and do it with your sanity intact, you need to learn a few tricks of the trade that can really help reduce the pressure of it all.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a list of the top 5 tips and tricks you should know to make <a href="https://www.theknot.com/wedding-planning">planning a wedding</a> as easy as possible:</p>
<p><strong>1. All-in-one event venue</strong></p>
<p>Finding and booking the venue can be a little tricky when you also have to find a venue for the reception, along with worrying about transportation logistics for guests.</p>
<p>You can avoid the hassle of using multiple locations for your wedding by finding a venue that provides it all on the same property. Many places offer a beautiful setting to say your vows and an adjoining hall for the celebration afterwards. Also, it&#8217;s an added benefit if a venue has hotel accommodations nearby to better serve your guests.</p>
<p><strong>2. Charge it for rewards</strong></p>
<p>Weddings can get really expensive, really fast. If you’re going to be using credit cards to finance your big day, research different credit card companies and find one with a really lucrative rewards program. Then, you can put all of your wedding expenses on that card and earn airline miles that you can use for your honeymoon or any number of reward varieties that might appeal to you.</p>
<p><strong>3. Check the Weather</strong></p>
<p>Surprises from mother nature always seem to happen at the worst times. Since you never know what the weather is going to be like on your big day, planning ahead for it is so important. Make sure you have a plan B readily available in the case of inclement weather. Work out the details before hand so you aren&#8217;t left in the rain on your wedding day.</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-31" src="http://saidwithcharm.com/file/2015/04/wedding-planning-300x201.jpg" alt="wedding-planning" width="300" height="201" srcset="http://saidwithcharm.com/file/2015/04/wedding-planning-300x201.jpg 300w, http://saidwithcharm.com/file/2015/04/wedding-planning.jpg 575w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />4. Control the guest list</strong></p>
<p>The infamous guest list has been a thorn in the side of many couples who are planning to celebrate their love with family and friends. Work out your list before booking a venue, and make sure the venue you pick can accommodate every person in your wedding party. It&#8217;s important to consider that each guest list has a significant amount of no-shows, but don&#8217;t forget to leave room for the catering staff, waiters, and the band at the reception.</p>
<p><strong>5. Budgeting</strong></p>
<p>So, the budget for a wedding can quickly spiral out of control if you&#8217;re not careful. It&#8217;s important to keep track of every purchase, and strategically plan for every expense. If you are having trouble with staying on budget, consider decreasing the amount of people on your guest list. Feeding and entertaining your guests can be one of your biggest expenses and you could save up to $100 for each guest you take off the list.</p>
<p>Planning a wedding should be a fun and exciting time in your life. Sadly, many people get weighed down with the seemingly endless list of details and to-do lists. Don&#8217;t let the stress of planning a big event ruin this special time in your life. With a little preparedness and smart planning, things will naturally fall into place.</p>

<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25" src="http://saidwithcharm.com/file/2015/04/Photography-10.jpg" alt="Photography-10" width="960" height="340" srcset="http://saidwithcharm.com/file/2015/04/Photography-10.jpg 960w, http://saidwithcharm.com/file/2015/04/Photography-10-300x106.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /></p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>Many couples believe that hiring a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedding_photography">professional wedding photographer</a> is an expense they cannot afford. They may resort to finding alternatives for the normal wedding photography services because they want to spend as little as possible. Most of these alternatives typically involve a family member or a friend. Some wedding planning sites even advise against hiring a professional photographer to minimize the expense. However, the truth is that not hiring a professional photographer is a recipe for disaster. Below are some reasons why we believe you should leave your wedding photography in the hands of a professional.</p>
<p><strong>A professional photographer is committed to you</strong></p>
<p>A professional wedding photographer will always be committed to you as well as the wedding day. They will guarantee you to show up on the d-day, no questions asked. There are situations where friends have committed to photographing a wedding, only to flake out just before the wedding. It can be disappointing when they do not show up on the wedding day as they promised. On the other hand, if you hire and pay a professional, he/she is contractually obligated to perform his/her duties.</p>
<p><strong>Experience is important</strong></p>
<p>Many important moments in a wedding day like the first kiss, exchange of rings and first dance only happens once in a lifetime. One of the major benefits you get as a result of hiring a professional is having their experience behind you so as to ensure you will be able to share these moments with your grandchildren. These events will not happen again, or get replayed. So, it noteworthy to have a photographer whom you can trust to document the shot.</p>
<p><strong>You are more like to get the shots you want</strong></p>
<p>There are many shots to take during the 8 to 10 hour wedding day celebration. Some of these shots are more important than others. A professional wedding photographer will know the most important shots by heart and not have to look at the list. This way, he/she will make sure that all the important moments of the wedding day are documented for you. This skill takes some time to be developed and cannot be mastered overnight. So, first time wedding photographers are likely to miss a bunch of major shots.</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-26" src="http://saidwithcharm.com/file/2015/04/06_01_2015_12_15_58-300x199.jpg" alt="06_01_2015_12_15_58" width="300" height="199" srcset="http://saidwithcharm.com/file/2015/04/06_01_2015_12_15_58-300x199.jpg 300w, http://saidwithcharm.com/file/2015/04/06_01_2015_12_15_58.jpg 513w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />A professional wedding photographer anticipates the action</strong></p>
<p>A professional photographer will not only identify the important shots to be captured, but also anticipate the day’s actions. He/she will know what to watch for and also cues that can lead to a picture worthy moment. A professional does wedding almost on a weekly basis, so they are well conversant with the traditions of the day. They have on many occasions experienced the uh ohs as well as mishaps, the unplanned surprises. They will be there to capture these unexpected little treasures as soon as they happen.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Despite the familiarity or comfort of a friend or family member, and despite the potentially low cost of hiring them compared to hiring a professional wedding photographer, it is strongly advised against using a family member or a friend to photograph your wedding. If you think it is expensive to hire a professional, try an amateur.</p>

<p>Certainly not all DJs are the same, and after the food and drink at a wedding reception, a good wedding DJ is the next most important thing and certainly worth their weight in gold. Get your playlist to your DJ as soon as possible so that they are well prepared for the day.</p>
<p>The DJ isn&#8217;t necessarily good at just beat mixing for instance, but is flexible and knows how to adjust to each audience before them and to different events. They like to put together custom song lists created especially for certain events during the wedding ceremony and reception. For instance these playlists will be divided into categories such as &#8216;dinner music&#8217;, &#8216;dancing&#8217; music &#8216;, &#8216;background music&#8217; and so on. Experienced disc jockeys know crowds well and they are able to read the mood of different crowds and select music accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>There is Always a Solid Back-Up</strong></p>
<p>A good wedding disc jockey always has somebody who stands in as a back-up if they can no longer be available at the wedding reception due to illness. They also have back-up services in place in case of equipment failure. They come equipped for all events whether you want your music played indoors or outside. Microphones and additional speakers are always part of their set-up to ensure the music never stops.</p>
<p><strong>Surprised and Delighted</strong></p>
<p>The price you pay is many times linked to the quality of the services you&#8217;re hiring. When it comes to a good wedding DJ, word of mouth is your best bet and this will give you peace of mind that you have the cream of the crop. You want the best on your wedding day and your friends are bound to put forward the names of the most gifted wedding DJs. Then it is up to you to not delay but to book them, because with their prices and services, they&#8217;ll be booked in a flash.</p>
