			<h2> 5 things you should definitely do to ace your essay</h2>
			<p>If you don’t have talent in writing, composing a simple essay can be a great struggle. You will try for hours to write the same idea and in the end you will not be satisfied with the result. This is because you did not take your time to develop your skills. However, if you start now in a few weeks you will write essays without too much effort, and your professor will definitely notice that you are better now. To begin with, here are 5 things that you have to do to ace your assignment:</p>

<h3>Discuss with your professor.</h3>
<p> This is something that most of the students don’t do, but they should do it and for many reasons. First of all, it is necessary for your teacher to know what subject you are planning to approach before and not after you completed your assignment. In this way he will able to give you advice and explain what you have to do to ace your composition. More than this, he will understand that you are really dedicated to make this assignment a good one, and he will take this into consideration when he will give you your grade.</p>

<h3>Search for synonyms. </h3>
<p>If you want to make your composition better without too much effort, you can search for synonyms or new words and use them while writing. Naturally, before you do this you have to make sure that you are using them in the right way, as failing to do so can put you in a very awkward position in front of your professor and colleagues. If you find very complicated words you can even write down the definition and have it prepared just in case one of your colleagues asks you what does it mean and you want to have a good explanation.</p>
<h3>Find some nice quotes. </h3>
<p>There are times when you can’t express your ideas as good as you would want to, so the best way to save the assignment is to search for some good quotes or references. Make sure that you have trustworthy sources and that you mention all the information when you introduce the quote into the text. Most of the teachers will only tell you to write the name of the author, but in some situations you will be required to write from where you took the quote, when it was published and where. To save some space and make everything look more professional, you can write this at the end of the composition on a references page. </p>

			<h4 class="color1 p-b-32">Plan in advance. </h4>
			
<p>Time is very important when you have to write an essay, especially if you are not great at writing. You need at least a few days to complete your assignment, so don’t try to do everything in the last minute. If you know that you will have to work on your composition in the next week, let your friends know and don’t make any plans. In this way they will not call you and distract you while you are studying, and you will not feel bad that you have to cancel your plans to stay inside and study.</p>

		<h3>Find out what are your colleagues writing about.</h3>
<p> Of course, you should never take their ideas, but you can discuss with them about yours and you can find together new ways to approach certain issues. You all have the same class and you all studied from the same book, but you have different minds and you can see things from different points of view.</p>
