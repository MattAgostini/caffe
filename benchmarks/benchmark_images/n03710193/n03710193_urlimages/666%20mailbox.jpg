<div class="desc">Operating from 2004 to 2012, The Dartmouth Independent was an entirely online-based news and opinion publication at Dartmouth College in Hanover NH. Unlike most other campus magazines that offered political commentary, The Dartmouth Independent was unique in that it lacked a defined political allegiance. Notable achievements include winning the award for outstanding work its inaugural year, and publishing the definitive history of beer pong.
